## Notice
- This script only supports single resolution for now, resolution here stands for monitor resolution instead of game resolution
- If you are using 2K(2560*1440) monitor then the stock target.png should work for you
- If you are using monitors with different resolutions, please replace target.png with a png format screenshot similar to the stock one
